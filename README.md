Hi! My name is Dhron. =)

I study computer science and statistics at the University of Waterloo!

I'm really interested in functional programming, building API's, and working on backend infrastructure.

In the past, I've worked on infrastructure at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/info/atg/), I've built production-scale stuff at [Narvar](https://www.narvar.com), an ETL pipeline at the [Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/ubiquitous-health-technology-lab/), websites at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/), and taught OOP at [UWaterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/)!

Currently, I'm looking for full-time software engineering roles beginning in April 2020.

Want to get in touch?

I love talking in person! But these links below work too! :)
