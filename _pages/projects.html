<p>I like to program in my free time and I love attending hackathons! I'm also a beginner in photography. Here are some of the things I've done in my spare time:</p>

<div class="projects">
  <div class="grid no-gutters">
    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/rametta/Switter-client">HACKHARVARD</a></h4>
        <p>I attended HackHarvard 2016 and, with a group of four, demoed a web app that gathers tweets that contain ticker symbols, and performs a sentiment analysis using HPE's API to allow people to make smarter investments based on what people around the world are tweeting about a specific stock.</p>

    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/Dhron/HackWestern3">HACKWESTERN</a></h4>
        <p>I attended HackWestern 3, and created a website that, based on your current location and the number of calories you want to burn, gives you a path to jog so you achieve that workout goal using the Google Maps API. This was created in a group of three.</p>

    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/Dhron/ChampRotation">CHAMP ROTATION</a></h4>
        <p>This is a personal project, as I am an avid League of Legends player, wanted to create a website that shows the current free champions of the week and statistics for each individual champion. This was mainly so I could get a better understanding of API's and the League of Legends API in particular.</p>
