<p class="message">
My name is Dhron! I'm a Computer Science student at the <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>.
</p>

I'm really passionate about logic and computation and so I'm working hard to learn as much as I can during my time in university. I'm always looking for ways to build my experience and do meaningful things with the knowledge I've gained.

Beyond computer science, I like to play the violin, perform magic tricks, and learn East Asian languages.

Whether you're a student or an employer, send me an e-mail if you're interested in talking!

&mdash; Dhron
