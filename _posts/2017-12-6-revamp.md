I've been meaning to do this for a while. I finally got around to it while I should be studying for exams! I wanted to make my site more content-oriented with more information about the things that I'm doing and working on rather than just an information hub.

I should also give credit to the framework this site is built off of and the theme that I'm using; the framework is called [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and the theming it's called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)! I changed a few things around to my liking but I really like the simplicity of how the posts look. I may add other functionality on top of this later like search, tags, and commenting so content is more organized and easy to find and can potentially host a discussion.

I really want to try writing more consistently as it's a good time to reflect on the things that I've learned and it promotes creativity.

Look out for more content in the future! But as of now...back to exam studying!

P.S. thank mr. goose
