subtitle: Spring 2017 Work Term
---

I worked for the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research as a Web Developer for my Spring 2017 work term. I was mainly involved with the design and testing of what the team was producing (bioinformatics.ca, facit.ca), but also developed code that went into production. I worked primarily with Node.js and the Koa framework in my development, and pushed code to validate Markdown files and json files. I also maintained the infrastructure of our staging servers and deployed instances of Apache Solr, MongoDB, and our Node.js backend. In addition, we used Jekyll, a static site generator (and what this site is built on) for the serving the front-end code.
