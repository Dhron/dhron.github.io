As an ISA (Instructional Support Assistant) for CS246 (Object-Oriented Software Development), I got to learn a lot about what goes on behind-the-scenes in a computer science course. I got to interact with professors, and course supervisors and learned about their duties and responsibilites in regards to running a course.

I was responsible for a lot of the aspects that one would expect as a student involved with the course administration; teaching and developing tutorials, holding office hours, handling student appointments, marking, remarking, and more marking.

I had a fantastic time; I gained a new perspective on a course I took in the past, got to teach my fellow 2nd year students, made some amazing friends and got to connect and interact with professors. 

While I'm using co-op to discover what areas of work I like the best, I would love to be an ISA again sometime in the future.
