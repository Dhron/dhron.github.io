title: Spring 2017 Work Term
---

I worked for the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research as a Web Developer for my Spring 2017 work term. I was mainly involved with the design and testing of what the team was producing ([bioinformatics.ca](bioinformatics.ca), [facit.ca](facit.ca)), but also developed code that went into production. I worked primarily with Node.js and the Koa framework in my development, and pushed code to validate Markdown files and json files. I also maintained the infrastructure of our staging servers and deployed instances of Apache Solr, MongoDB, and our Node.js backend. In addition, we used Jekyll, a static site generator (and what this site is built on) for the serving the front-end code. 

I think this coop term made me realize that the culture of the team and your workplace are very important, along with your level of interest in the work. I realized I'm more interested in implementation details and how systems work rather than the preliminary design and documentation. At OICR WebDev, the responsibility passed down to coops is relatively little and I would say that while it was interesting to support the team, I would've liked more responsibility and technical challenges.
