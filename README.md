I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo!

In the past, I've built production-scale stuff at [Narvar](https://www.narvar.com), an ETL pipeline at the [Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/ubiquitous-health-technology-lab/), websites at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/), and taught OOP at [UWaterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/)!

sometimes I code, write blog posts, and take pictures. stick around and explore! (it's a work in progress ok)

Want to get in touch?

I love talking in person! But these links below work too! :)
